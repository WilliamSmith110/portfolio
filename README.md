# My Portfolio

A modern, responsive portfolio website built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline with Docker

This project includes a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Docker for automated building, testing, and deployment.

### üê≥ Docker Setup

The project uses a multi-stage Docker build optimized for static export with nginx:

```bash
# Build the Docker image locally
docker build -t portfolio .

# Run the container
docker run -p 80:80 portfolio

# Access your portfolio at http://localhost
```

### üîß GitHub Actions CI/CD

The CI/CD pipeline includes:

1. **Test Job**: Lints code and builds the application
2. **Build & Push Job**: Creates Docker image and pushes to Docker Hub
3. **Deploy Job**: Provides deployment instructions

#### Setup Requirements

1. **Docker Hub Account**: Create an account at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

2. **GitHub Secrets**: Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
   - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token

   To add secrets:
   - Go to your GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Add the secrets above

3. **Docker Hub Token**: Generate a token at Docker Hub:
   - Go to Docker Hub ‚Üí Account Settings ‚Üí Security
   - Click "New Access Token"
   - Copy the token and add it to GitHub secrets

#### Pipeline Triggers

- **Push to `main`**: Runs full CI/CD (test ‚Üí build ‚Üí push ‚Üí deploy)
- **Push to `develop`**: Runs tests only
- **Pull Request to `main`**: Runs tests only

#### Docker Image

The pipeline creates and pushes Docker images to:
- `williamsmith/portfolio:latest` (main branch)
- `williamsmith/portfolio:develop` (develop branch)
- `williamsmith/portfolio:sha-{commit}` (specific commits)

### üöÄ Deployment

After the pipeline runs successfully, you can deploy your portfolio:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull williamsmith/portfolio:latest

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name portfolio williamsmith/portfolio:latest

# Or with custom port
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name portfolio williamsmith/portfolio:latest
```

### üìÅ Project Structure

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                         # Other project files
```

### üîç Monitoring

- **Health Check**: Visit `/health` endpoint for container health
- **Logs**: Check nginx logs for debugging
- **GitHub Actions**: Monitor pipeline status in Actions tab

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Test Docker build locally
docker build -t portfolio .
docker run -p 80:80 portfolio
```
